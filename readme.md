## Pricing Test

### Goal
Pricing optimization is, non surprisingly, another area where data science can provide huge value. The goal here is to evaluate whether a pricing test running on the site has been successful. As always, you should focus on user segmentation and provide insights about segments who behave differently as well as any other insights you might find.

### Challenge Description
Company XYZ sells a software for $39. Since revenue has been flat for some time, the VP of
Product has decided to run a test increasing the price. She hopes that this would increase
revenue. In the experiment, 66% of the users have seen the old price ($39), while a random
sample of 33% users a higher price ($59).
The test has been running for some time and the VP of Product is interested in understanding
how it went and whether it would make sense to increase the price for all the users.
Especially he asked you the following questions:
       Should the company sell its software for $39 or $59?
       The VP of Product is interested in having a holistic view into user behavior, especially
       focusing on actionable insights that might increase conversion rate. What are your main
       findings looking at the data?
       [Bonus] The VP of Product feels that the test has been running for too long and he should
       have been able to get statistically significant results in a shorter time. Do you agree with
       her intuition? After how many days you would have stopped the test? Please, explain
       why.
                                                                                                    
### Data

We have two tables are `test_results.csv` and `user_table.csv`

Columns:

      `user_id : the Id of the user. Can be joined to user_id in user_table
      timestamp : the date and time when the user hit for the first time company XYZ
      webpage. It is in user local time
      source : marketing channel that led to the user coming to the site. It can be:
               ads-["google", "facebook", "bing", "yahoo", "other"]. That is, user coming from
               google ads, yahoo ads, etc.
               seo - ["google", "facebook", "bing", "yahoo", "other"]. That is, user coming from
               google search, yahoo, facebook, etc.
               friend_referral : user coming from a referral link of another user
               direct_traffic: user coming by directly typing the address of the site on the browser
      device : user device. Can be mobile or web
      operative_system : user operative system. Can be: "windows", "linux", "mac" for web,
      and "android", "iOS" for mobile. Other if it is none of the above
      test: whether the user was in the test (i.e. 1 -> higher price) or in control (0 -> old lower
      price)
      price : the price the user sees. It should match test
      converted : whether the user converted (i.e. 1 -> bought the software) or not (0 -> left
      the site without buying it).`
  "user_table" - Information about the user
Columns:

      `user_id : the Id of the user. Can be joined to user_id in test_results table
      city : the city where the user is located. Comes from the user ip address
      country : in which country the city is located
      lat : city latitude - should match user city
                                                                                                    
       long : city longitude - should match user city`
        
   
Example

`head(test_results,1)
  Column Name             Value              Description
  user_id                 604839             The Id of the user
                          2015-05-08         The user landed on the site on May, 8 at 3 and
  timestamp
                          03:38:34           38AM (and 34 seconds).
  source                  ads_facebook       User came via Facebook ads
  device                  mobile             User was using mobile
  operative_system        iOS                Was using iOS
  test                    0                  Was in the control group, i.e. seeing the old price
  price                   39                 Indeed, the price she saw was just $39
  converted               0                  Alas, left the site without purchasing the software
        Let's check location info for that user
subset (user_table,user_id == 604839)
  Column Name          Value       Description
  user_id              604839      User id. Same user as in the previous table
  city                 Buffalo      She was based in Buffalo when she hit the site
  country              USA         The country where Buffalo is
  lat                  42.89       Buffalo latitude
  long                 -78.86      Buffalo longitude`
